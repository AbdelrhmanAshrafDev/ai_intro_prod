## What if wanna make it as front with simple backend?
Yes, your approach is absolutely doable and can work well for creating an advanced yet manageable AI-based app. Here’s a breakdown of the recommended steps and considerations to help you keep the project streamlined:

### **1. Frontend in Vue.js (Host on Netlify)**

   - **Setup**: Vue.js works well with Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. Hosting is free, and deployment is simple—just connect your repository to the hosting service, and it will automatically build and deploy your site.
   - **Component-Based UI**: Use Vue components to keep the interface modular. This way, adding or modifying sections for different medical visualizations or interactive elements is easier.
   - **Fetching API**: Use Axios (or Vue's built-in `fetch` API) to make requests to your FastAPI backend. This keeps the code clean and improves maintainability.

### **2. Backend with FastAPI (Host on Deta or Railway)**

   - **Model Logic in Python**: FastAPI is perfect for handling requests to Python-based AI models. By hosting on **Deta** or **Railway**, you can avoid the complexity of a full backend infrastructure while serving model responses via an API endpoint.
   - **Asynchronous Requests**: FastAPI supports async requests, which allows your Vue app to handle responses efficiently and makes it feel fast for the end-user.
   - **Example API**: Here’s a simplified FastAPI endpoint that returns AI model results:
     ```python
     from fastapi import FastAPI
     from some_model_library import load_model, generate_response

     app = FastAPI()
     model = load_model("path_to_your_model")

     @app.get("/predict")
     async def predict(prompt: str):
         result = generate_response(model, prompt)
         return {"result": result}
     ```

### **3. Connecting Frontend to Backend**

   - **Vue Fetch Request**: Fetch results from the FastAPI endpoint using Axios in your Vue app.
   - **Example Axios Call**:
     ```javascript
     import axios from 'axios';

     async function fetchPrediction(prompt) {
         try {
             const response = await axios.get('https://your-backend-url/predict', { params: { prompt } });
             return response.data.result;
         } catch (error) {
             console.error("Error fetching prediction:", error);
             return null;
         }
     }
     ```

### **4. Hosting Options**

   - **Frontend**: Netlify or Vercel for free hosting, which supports automatic redeployment when you push to your GitHub repository.
   - **Backend**: Use Deta (free up to a specific limit) or Railway (provides a generous free tier) to deploy your FastAPI app.

### **5. Recommendations for Keeping It Simple but Advanced**

   - **Limit API Complexity**: Avoid creating too many endpoints; focus on a few essential endpoints that support your app’s main features.
   - **Streamlined Frontend UI**: Focus on a clean, straightforward UI that directs doctors or students to interact with your model outputs easily.
   - **Caching Results**: If certain prompts are repeatedly requested, caching responses on the FastAPI side can reduce latency.

### **Pros of This Setup**

   - **Scalable Yet Simple**: It’s modular, making future expansions (new features or more complex model integrations) easier.
   - **Minimal Hosting Needs**: Since both frontend and backend are separately hosted, maintenance is manageable.
   - **Professional Look**: A Vue frontend hosted on Netlify looks professional and can handle interactive elements well.

This setup allows you to balance advanced features with simplicity, especially by avoiding heavy backend work while still delivering a polished, scalable app. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any step!
